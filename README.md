# Tickets!

[Play it here!](http://insectatorious.github.io/2048/)

A small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

Original version: http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/ Special thanks to him for making this excellent game available!

The objective is to get at least one ticket to the 'Resolved' state. Tickets progress linearly along the following stages:

1. New
1. Research
1. Chase 3rd Party
1. Business Review
1. Implementation
1. Code Review
1. QA
1. Regression
1. Deployment
1. Prod Follow-up
1. Resolved

Note: Under the hood this is still the same game (2048), a small text tweak has been made to display the different ticket stages.

I made this in my spare time. It's hosted on GitHub (which means there aren't any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address: `19tHC9fgYpVnQYYxdA9C7s2PrhJaC3wDFU`. Thank you very much!
