# Tickets!
A small clone of [2048](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

Original version: [Play it here!](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/) Special thanks to him for making this excellent game available!

The objective is to get at least one ticket to the 'Resolved' state. Tickets progress linearly along the following stages:

1. New
1. Research
1. Chase 3rd Party
1. Business Review
1. Implementation
1. Code Review
1. QA
1. Deployment
1. Prod Follow-up
1. Resolved

Note: Under the hood this is still the same game (2048), a small text tweak has been made to display the different ticket stages.

## Contributing
Changes and improvements are more than welcome! Feel free to fork and open a pull request. Please make your changes in a specific branch and request to pull into `master`! If you can, please make sure the game fully works before sending the PR, as that will help speed up the process.

## Donations
I made this in my spare time, trying to avoid looking at my very long ticket list! It's hosted on GitHub (which means I don't have any hosting costs), but if you enjoyed the game and feel like buying me coffee, you can donate at my BTC address: ``. Thank you very much!
